### Amazon Rating Products and Sorting Reviews

**Overview** 
This project focuses on analyzing and understanding product ratings and sorting reviews on Amazon. Using Python, the project dives into exploratory data analysis (EDA), providing insights into customer behaviors and preferences. It also demonstrates effective data manipulation and visualization techniques.

**Key Features**
Product Rating Analysis: Identifies trends and patterns in product ratings to understand customer satisfaction.
Review Sorting: Implements algorithms to sort reviews based on relevance, helpfulness, and sentiment.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizes statistical and graphical methods to uncover insights from data.
Data Visualization: Creates intuitive plots and charts for better understanding of the dataset.
Python Libraries: Leverages powerful libraries like pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

**Dataset**
The dataset includes Amazon product reviews with the following key features:
Product details (name, category, etc.)
Customer reviews (text, rating, helpfulness score, etc.)
Metadata (review date, reviewer ID, etc.)
Source
The dataset was sourced from Amazon Review Dataset (replace with the actual link if available).

**Objectives**
Analyze the distribution of product ratings to identify trends.
Develop algorithms to sort reviews based on specific criteria:
Relevance
Helpfulness
Sentiment polarity
Visualize key findings for enhanced interpretability.

**Insights**
Rating Trends: Products with higher ratings have consistent themes in customer satisfaction.
Helpful Reviews: Certain linguistic and contextual elements make reviews more helpful to others.
Sentiment Analysis: Positive reviews often correlate with higher product ratings, while critical reviews provide constructive feedback.

**Methodology**
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values and duplicates.
Normalized text for sentiment analysis.

EDA:
Analyzed rating distributions and their correlations with other variables.
Identified the most reviewed and top-rated products.

Review Sorting:
Used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to score reviews based on helpfulness and sentiment.

Visualization:
Generated bar charts, scatter plots, and word clouds to represent insights.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Main programming language.

Libraries:
pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
Scikit-learn for machine learning.
NLTK/TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
